GRF library
===========

This library is NOT opensource, but is free to use.

You can submit bugs by mailing me (magicaltux@ookoo.org).

If you use my library, you can drop me an email, it'll give me more motivation
and will allow you to have more updates :)

Audio support on Linux with Qt
==============================

You need to compile your Qt library and include NAS support.

Gentoo:
echo "x11-libs/qt nas" >>/etc/portage/package.use

Configure: add option -system-nas-sound
